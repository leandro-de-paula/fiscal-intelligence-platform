# Manifesto — Fiscal Intelligence Platform

## 1. Purpose
Build an intelligent fiscal platform that combines business rules,
automation, AI, and mature software engineering to support fiscal decisions
and reduce incorrect tax payments.

This project also serves as a practical case study of full SDLC application.

## 2. Principles
- API-first from day one
- Modularity over tight coupling
- Heavy processing always asynchronous
- Architectural decisions must be documented
- Testing is part of design
- Scalability is a requirement, not a future improvement
- AI is a workflow tool, not an isolated feature

## 3. Stack (Defined)
- Core Backend: Laravel 12 (API)
- Intelligent Engines: Python + FastAPI
- Frontend: React
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Infrastructure: GCP
- Queues and asynchronous processing
- AI provider abstraction with fallback support

## 4. Adopted SDLC
- Continuous discovery with the first customers (ERP Devs + Technical Accountants)
- Documented design (C4 + ADRs)
- Incremental builds by versions
- Layered testing strategy
- Automated deployment
- Minimum observability from MVP
- Evolution driven by real feedback

## 5. Commitment
This project prioritizes clarity, technical sustainability, and real market value,
avoiding shortcuts that compromise scalability or quality.
